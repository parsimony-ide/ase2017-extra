This repository contains definitions for the Fuyu and Hachiya languages from
the ASE 2017 paper titled "Parsimony: An IDE for Example-Guided Synthesis of
Lexers and Parsers."

`LEXER` and `PARSER` document Parsimony's syntax for lexer and parser
definitions, respectively. 

Subdirectories `fuyu` and `hachiya` contain corresponding definitions for the
Fuyu and Hachiya languages, respectively, where files with extension `.t` are
lexer definitions and those with extension `.g` are parser definitions.
